# Breath_detection_ML

This respository contains the breath detection MATLAB code for the interspeech paper (2019) "Automatic Detection of Breath Using Voice Activity Detection and SVM Classifier with Application on News Reports"

The paper is available at https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/pdfs/2434.pdf

Please cite the paper while using the code.

The MATLAB program needs to add functions voice box. http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/voicebox/voicebox.html
Please download this file to Functions folder. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g6E-6fKr9_brjZsi2hRBUY9RRt_lT8h2/view?usp=sharing
